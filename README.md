The point of this project is analysing the functional subcircuits of C. elegans to see if there is special or strange pattern found in their connectivity graph. this could help use understand why these specific subnetworks can show orgenized and coordinated activities leading to behavior while random networks don't.

with the functions here you can import the most uptodat connectivity matrix from wormwiring webpage and import if with xlsToMat or XlsToMatGeneral into the proper format to be used with other functions.
